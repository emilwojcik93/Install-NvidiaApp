# Install-NvidiaApp
This PowerShell script detects an NVIDIA GPU, retrieves the latest NVIDIA App installer (Enterprise or Public edition), and facilitates its download and installation with customizable parameters. It supports a dry run mode, verifies GPU presence, and allows forced installation even if no GPU is detected or the same version is already installed.
